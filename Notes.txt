PRIMARY KEY
-----------
It is a column(or set of columns) in a table that uniquely identifies each row.
Primary key should not be NULL.


FOREIGN KEY
-----------
It is a column(or set of columns) in a table that refers to the primary key in other table.
There can be multiple FKs.
Foreign Keys can have duplicate and NULL values.


CONSTRAINTS
-----------
NOT NULL
UNIQUE
PRIMARY KEY
FOREIGN KEY
DEFAULT
CHECK(Condition)


SELECT, WHERE, DISTINCT, LIMIT

OPERATORS
---------
Arithmetic Operators : +, -, *, /, %
Comparison Operators : =, >, <, >=, <=, <>
Logical Operators : AND, OR, NOT, IN, BETWEEN, EXISTS, LIKE, SOME, ALL, ANY

AGGREGATE FUNCTIONS
-------------------
COUNT()
MAX()
MIN()
SUM()
AVG()


GROUP BY
--------
Groups rows that have same values into summary rows.
It collects data from multiple records and groups the result by one or more column.

* Generally we use GROUP BY with some aggregate function.


HAVING(Condition on groups)
------
Similar to where i.e. applies some condition on rows.
Used when we want to apply any condition after grouping


GENERAL ORDER
-------------
SELECT, FROM, WHERE, GROUP BY, HAVING, ORDER BY


FOREIGN KEY
-----------
CASCADING -
1. On delete Cascade - When we create a foreign key using this option, it deletes the referencing rows in the child table when the referenced row is deleted in the parent table which has a primary key
2. On update Cascade - When we create a foreign key using this option, it updates the referencing rows in the child table when the referenced row is deleted in the parent table which has a primary key


Types of SQL Commands
---------------------
1. DDL(Data Definition Language) - CREATE, ALTER, RENAME, TRUNCATE, DROP
2. DQL(Data Query Language) - SELECT
3. DML(Data Manipulation Language) - INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE
4. DCL(Data Control Language) - GRANT, REVOKE
5. TCL(Transaction Control Language) - BEGIN, COMMIT, ROLLBACK, SAVEPOINT

DDL(Data Definition Language)
-----------------------------
ALTER
-----
ADD Column - ALTER TABLE table_name ADD COLUMN column_name datatype constraint;
MODIFY Column (datatype/constraint) - ALTER TABLE table_name MODIFY COLUMN column_name new_datatype new_constraint;
CHANGE Column(rename) - ALTER TABLE table_name CHANGE COLUMN old_name new_name new_datatype new_constraint; 
DROP Column- ALTER TABLE table_name DROP COLUMN column_name;

NOTE : COLUMN keyword is optional in MODIFY, CHANGE, DROP. Never used in RENAME.

RENAME Table - ALTER TABLE table_name RENAME TO new_table_name;
TRUNCATE (to delete table's data) - TRUNCATE TABLE table_name;

DML(Data Manipulation Language) COMMANDS
---------------------------------------
UPDATE Rows - UPDATE table_name SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ... WHERE condition;
DELETE Row - DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;
	   - DELETE FROM table_name;  -- this deletes everything in the table!
